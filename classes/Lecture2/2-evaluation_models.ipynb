    "The objective evaluation models is to check the ability of a component to operate in its safe operating area for the required lifetime and reliability. After reviewing the state of the art of the main design drivers that limit the performance and endurance of mechatronic components, this lecture describes the possible models and ways of implementing them in system simulation environments by focusing on lifetime evaluation.  \n",

    "- **Transient power demands** to ensure system performance: the models have to analyze the maximum stress (such as torque or speed) to avoid rapid deterioration. Component degradation can be avoided if the use is kept inside a Safe Operating Area (SOA). This point can be checked by the simulation models and operating domains deduced from the estimation models.    \n",
    "- **Continuous power demands** to ensure the endurance of the system: the models have to calculate quantities equivalent to the nominal point of operation and reliability rate in order to avoid critical degradation over time (e.g. fatigue). This point will be treated in greater detail in this chapter.  \n",

Nevertheless, when normal conditions of functioning (lubrication, sealing, etc.) are assumed, the first fatigue phenomena must be rolling fatigue of bearings, as gears are often designed to have much higher tooth flexural or Hertz stress fatigue limits. The **rolling fatigue** can be displayed in a log-log diagram.\n",

    "The concept is based on the **Palmgren Miner law**. Here $N_{10}$ refers to the standard number of load cycles for bearings (normally 1 million cycles) that can be guaranteed for a standard reliability of 90%, $\\alpha$ is the applied stress and $Q$ the resulting sum of cumulated damage. For the same component and the same reliability, the amount of cumulative damage must remain constant and identical whatever the ($N_{10}$,$σ$) pair leading to degradation of the component. For rolling components, the power coefficient $\\alpha$ is a value greater than 1 and indicates that a larger load causes more damage than a load of lower value. For ball bearings, this coefficient is equal to 3. The cycle number $N_{10}$ has no power coefficient which indicates that **the amount of damage is linear and cumulative**.\n",
