    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The **Concept of Operations (ConOps)** and **system architecture** are fundamental for designing efficient and reliable systems. This chapter introduces these concepts independently of any specific application, followed by a focused example on a **multirotor UAV for package delivery**.\n",

    "### 1.1 What is a Concept of Operations (ConOps)?\n",
    "- **Definition**: A Concept of Operations (ConOps) is a high-level description of how a system is intended to operate to achieve its objectives.\n",
    "- **Purpose**:\n",
    "  - Align stakeholders on the system’s goals, functionality, and usage.\n",
    "  - Provide a foundation for defining system requirements and architecture.\n",

    "   - Stakeholders can include:\n",
    "     - Primary users and operators.\n",
    "     - Maintenance teams.\n",
    "     - Regulatory bodies.\n",
    "     - Secondary users or beneficiaries.\n",
    "   - Needs are specific to the context and include performance, safety, and operational requirements.\n",

    "### 2.1 What is a System Architecture?\n",
    "- **Definition**: A structured representation of the system that describes its components, interactions, and organization to meet its objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Types of System Architectures\n",
    "1. **Functional Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Describes what the system does.\n",
    "   - Focuses on the flow of information and interactions between functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Physical Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Describes how the system is organized physically.\n",
    "   - Defines the layout, placement, and interaction of hardware components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operational Architecture**:\n",
    "   - Focuses on how the system interacts with external entities.\n",
    "   - Includes communication, data exchange, and system integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Key Principles of System Architecture\n",
    "1. **Modularity**:\n",
    "   - Breaking down the system into smaller, independent components.\n",
    "   - Facilitates upgrades, repairs, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Ability to scale performance or capacity based on future needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Redundancy**:\n",
    "   - Adding backups for critical systems to improve reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interoperability**:\n",
    "   - Ensuring compatibility with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Trade-Off Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Balancing competing priorities like cost, performance, and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Steps to Develop a System Architecture\n",
    "1. Identify key functions the system must perform.\n",
    "2. Define components needed to perform these functions.\n",
    "3. Map functional components to physical components.\n",
    "4. Specify interactions between components and external systems.\n",
    "5. Analyze trade-offs and refine the architecture.\n",
