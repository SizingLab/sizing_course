Evaluation models - Summary
=========================

This chapter presents the estimation models that calculate the component characteristics requested for their selection without requiring a detailed design. These models can be obtained by regression of catalogue data.  Scaling laws are also particularly suitable for this purpose. After introducing the assumptions necessary for the implementation of these laws, various examples of use are given.
