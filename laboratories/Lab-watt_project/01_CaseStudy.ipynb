    "- On the sidewalk: a charging station or \"totem\" with the connection, as well as a pack of super capacitors, all integrated in the urban landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each totem (or charging station) is connected to the household electricity distribution network and allows charging between the passage of each bus. There is no need for specific equipment (substation, transformer).\n",
    "In operation the bus is powered by supercapacitors, it travels the necessary distance to the next stop, thanks to the energy stored.\n",
    "At each stop, the arm deploys and realizes in 10 seconds the transfer of energy between the super capacitors of the totem and the super capacitors onboard the bus.\n",
    "An adapted Lithium-ion battery pack is installed in the bus for cases of impossibility of connection and trips without passengers.\n",
