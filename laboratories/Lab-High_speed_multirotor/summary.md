Lab - Multirotor case study
=======================

Multirotor UAVs are interesting mechatronic systems for sizing, particularly in an educational or academic context. They present a number of dimensioning scenarios involving components from several technologies. Couplings are numerous and strong, particularly in terms of on-board mass.
