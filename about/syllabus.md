## Course Description

### Objectives
Mechatronic and aerospace systems are highly complex systems that often have to meet specific and severe requirements depending of the application. Several architectures in terms of topology and technology often meet the functional requirements and technological constraints. The ultimate objective is to determine the best of candidate architectures in terms of environmental performance and cost. For this purpose, this course aims at providing methods and models for sizing systems composed of multiple technologies.

### Content
