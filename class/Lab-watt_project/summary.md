Lab - WATT System - DC/DC converter sizing
=======================

```{warning}
This course is under construction...
```

This project can be used as an introduction to static converter sizing. In order to book the most time to practice, theoretical and methodological elements about modeling and sizing have to be adressed formerly. 
The present material can be adressed in 4 sessions of 2h30min: 

Lab 1: Architecture & sizing scenarios  
-Case study presentation
-Architecture of the converter
-Sizing scenarios equations

Lab 2: Estimation models  
-Scaling laws
-Heat sink & Linear regression

Lab 3: Sizing code of an inductor   
-Sizing code  
-Use of surrogate models  
  
Lab 4: Sizing code of an DC/DC converter & Design exploration  
-Sizing code of DC/DC converter (introduction)  
-Global optimization and design exploration
