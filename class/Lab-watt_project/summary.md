```

This project can bu used as an introduction to static converter sizing. In order to book the most time to practice, theoretical and methodological elements about modeling and sizing have to be adressed formerly. 
The present material can be adressed in 4 sessions of 2h30 min: 

##### Lab 1: Architecture & sizing scenarios
1. Case study presentation
2. Architecture of the converter
3. Sizing scenarios equations

##### Lab 2: Estimation models 
4. Scaling laws
5. Heat sink & Linear regression

##### Lab 3: Sizing code of an inductor 
6. Sizing code
7. Use of surrogate models

##### Lab 4: Sizing code of an DC/DC converter & Design exploration
8. Sizing code of DC/DC converter (introduction)
9. Global optimization and design exploration
