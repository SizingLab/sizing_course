The sizing scenarios are part of the specification process and may include both transient and endurance criteria, such as maximum rate of climb and hover flight endurance. The final overall design has to consider simultaneously the various sizing scenarios that may impact the components selection through **design drivers**."

As we are minimizing the total mass $M_{total,real}$ the oversizing coefficient $k_{os}$ will tend to be as small as possible and thus the inequality constraint will be equivalent to an equality constraint ($M_{total} = M_{total,real}$).
