Lab - VEGA Launcher TVC EMA case study
=======================

This laboratory will seek to illustrate approaches for selecting the main components of an **Electromechanical Actuator (EMA)**:
- **Electric Motor:** Converts electrical energy into mechanical motion.
- **Gearbox:** Amplifies torque to deflect the engine or nozzle.
- **Power and force transmission**: Converts torque into linear motion   

The aspect:    
- **Control Electronics:** Manages actuator positioning and feedback loops for precision.  

will not be covered here but will be illustrated in other case studies in this course.

The rest of this case study consists of two distinct parts:

The **first part** aims to provide a concise and simplified overview of the main concepts and models useful for preliminary design:
- estimation models and scaling laws
- simulation and evaluation models
- implementation of an optimal sizing code
The approaches will be illustrated using Excel or Python implementations.

The **second part** revisits these concepts with a more refined mechanical model that allows greater design freedom in terms of actuator positioning.
