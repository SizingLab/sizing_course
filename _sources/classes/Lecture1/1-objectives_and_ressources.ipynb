    "This Figure is a graphic illustration of how classical types of requirements and the key design drivers are associated in an actuation system. Such systems must meet a variety of requirements:\n",
    "-\t At **functional level**, multiple operational modes may be requested. In addition to the primary function of positioning in active mode, specific modes can be added for each application: no load standby or passive damping for an aileron control surface, active damping for a TVC, free castering for steering, etc. These functions will require additional specific components or control loops (max speed limitation function of position or flight condition, load limitation, etc.).\n",
    "-\tAt **performance level**, the requirements may relate to transient or continuous forces, maximum speeds, damping coefficients, accuracy levels, bandwidths, stability coefficients, stiffness or disturbance rejection, etc. These different levels of performance and endurance can also be expressed by typical or critical mission profiles. \n",
    "-\tAt **integration level**, the requirements may constrain the geometrical envelope or the mass, or define the attachment points. The environmental constraints are also numerous for embedded systems : thermal stress, shocks and vibrations, electromagnetic pollution, humidity levels ... The first two points, heat and vibration can have a dramatic effect on electrical components or slender mechanical housings.\n",
    "-\tAt **reliability level**, a critical system like an aileron must present a fail-safe operation associated with a high rate of reliability for each mode. These requirements may have a significant impact on the complexity of the architecture for power transmission, monitoring or control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The designer has a panel of degrees of freedom to respond to. The choice of the components, their combination and their technology, i.e. the architecture, provides a first set. The size chosen for the components, the parameters of the kinematic transmission, the shapes of displacement curves, i.e. the sizing, give a second set. The overlaps between these degrees of freedom and requirements are numerous and interconnected.\n",
    "The design of the operating part of a mechatronic system therefore involves a relatively large number of components of different technologies. Each component has specific design drivers to satisfy multiple requirements. \n",

    "Different types of models are used during the process of developing of a mechatronic system. In the descending phase of the V, the system is gradually defined and the complexity of the models increases accordingly. During the first phase, modeling and simulation are typically used to validate the correctness of the design choices.  \n",
    "First, a functional description of the system to be developed is made using functional simulation models (software tools: UML, SysML, etc.).  \n",
    "In a second step, the \"solution concepts\" are identified and corresponding physical or behavioural simulation models are developed. These physical models can be static (software tools: Matlab, Mathcad, spreadsheet, etc.) or dynamic (software tools: Matlab / Simulink, Dymola, AMESim, etc.).  \n",

It is then possible to produce 3D models of these components (software tools: Catia, Abaqus, Flux3D, etc.). These 3D models can perform local computations (finite element) and can thus verify the properties of the developed components more accurately.     \n",
    "Finally, during the system integration phase, the various components are assembled to form the solution concepts and validate their performance. To do this, the highly detailed 3D simulation models, are transformed into less detailed 0D-1D macro-models in order to perform physical simulations.\n",
