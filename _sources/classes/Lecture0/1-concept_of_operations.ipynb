    "# Introduction to Concept of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the Concept of Operations (ConOps) in systems engineering. It explains the purpose, components, and importance of a ConOps in the system development process. The section also outlines the steps involved in developing a ConOps document. It is mainly based on the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Concept of Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Concept of Operations (ConOps)** is a foundational document in systems engineering that describes the characteristics of a proposed system from the stakeholders' perspectives. It provides a user-oriented view of the system, detailing how it will be employed to achieve the desired objectives without delving into technical specifications. A ConOps bridges the gap between the operational needs and the technical requirements, serving as a guide throughout the system's lifecycle.\n",

    "- **Communicate User Needs**: Clearly articulate what users expect from the system.\n",
    "- **Guide Development**: Inform system designers and developers about operational expectations.\n",
    "- **Facilitate Understanding**: Ensure all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system's purpose and operation.\n",
    "- **Support Decision-Making**: Provide a basis for trade-off analyses and design decisions.\n",
